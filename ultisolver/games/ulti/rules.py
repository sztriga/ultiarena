"""Trick-taking rules for 3-player Ulti.

Two rule sets depending on contract:

**Normal (Simple / Ulti / Durchmars / 40-100 / …):**
  - Must follow the led suit.
  - If following suit, must beat the highest same-suit card played so far
    (if possible).
  - If unable to follow suit, must play trump (if possible).
  - If trumping, must beat the highest trump played so far (if possible).

**Betli:**
  - Must follow the led suit.
  - Must beat the highest same-suit card (using Betli strength ordering).
  - No trump.
