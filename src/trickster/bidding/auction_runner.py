    Parameters
    ----------
    gs : GameState
        Must have 10-card hands for all players.
    talon : list[Card]
        The 2 initial talon cards.
    dealer : int
        Dealer seat index.
    seat_wrappers : list of 3 dicts
        ``seat_wrappers[seat]`` maps contract_key → UltiNetWrapper.
        For self-play pass the same dict three times.
    min_bid_pts : float
        Minimum expected per-defender stakes to place a bid.
    bid_temp : float
        Softmax temperature for first-bidder contract selection.
        0 = greedy (eval default), >0 = exploratory (training).
    c_explore : float
        UCB exploration constant.  Only used when *bid_temp* > 0.
    dk_game_counts : dict
        Per-display-key cumulative game counts for UCB bonus.
    pickup_explore : float
        Epsilon-greedy pickup exploration probability.
    n_talon_samples : int
        Number of random talon samples for Kermit-style pickup evaluation.
    pickup_quantile : float or list[float]
        Quantile for Kermit-style pickup evaluation.  A single float
        applies to all seats; a 3-element list sets per-seat quantiles.
    rng : random.Random
        RNG for stochastic decisions.  Required when any exploration
        parameter is non-zero.
    bidding_strategy : str
        ``"kermit"`` (default) or ``"cfr"``.  When ``"cfr"``, uses
        the CFR strategy table for pickup/bid decisions.
    cfr_strategies : list[CFRStrategy | None] | None
        Per-seat CFR strategy tables.  Required when ``bidding_strategy
        == "cfr"``.  ``None`` entries fall back to Kermit for that seat.
