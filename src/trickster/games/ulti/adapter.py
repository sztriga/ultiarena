"""UltiGame — implements GameInterface for AlphaZero training / MCTS.

Wraps the Ulti game engine behind the generic GameInterface protocol
so that MCTS, training, and evaluation code remain game-agnostic.

Key design points for Ulti (vs. Snapszer):
  - 3 players (1 soloist vs. 2 defenders)
  - Defenders form a *coalition*: ``same_team`` returns True for both.
  - Action space = 32 (one per card in the deck).
  - ``new_game`` automatically performs the pre-play setup
    (deal → talon pickup → random discard → random contract) so that
    training focuses on the play phase.

v2 upgrades:
  - UltiNode carries auction context (bid, kontras, dealer)
  - Inference-enhanced PIMC: determinize() respects auction constraints
    (marriage declarations, bid-implied card holdings)
  - Expanded encoder (259-dim) with card counting, contract DNA, etc.
